I will assume that you already know the basic of nuxt.js. If not, you can check out their [documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

Now that it's yours, you can make changes to it. Be creative you can start by removing the contents in the `pages/index.vue`. Feel free to utilize the `GenericPanel.vue` component as it adds a nice balance to the layout.
